# loop.md — widget-shell

Worktree lead loop state. Source of truth for resume. Rule: if it isn't here,
it didn't happen.

- Change ID / branch: widget-shell
- Worktree: /home/choice/projects/customer-support/widget-shell
- Base: main @ cfb22a1 (contracts-foundation merged)
- testCommand: `npm --prefix widget test`
- doneCondition: manifest.yaml (all block types render from fixtures + match
  prototype; both entry seeds; interaction contracts; shell behaviors; one POST
  per action; accessToken never logged/persisted). Plus Gate-1 amendments:
  WebMCP registration (item 6) and agent-driven E2E (item 7).

## Contract resolutions (frozen schema is authoritative; NOT reinterpretation)
- [CONFIRM #1 — generated TS artifact] RESOLVED: `wireTypes.ts` is generated
  from `app/contracts/schema/chat_wire.schema.json` (the JSON-schema artifact),
  not hand-mirrored. Directed by assignment ("generate TS types from the
  checked-in schema").
- [CONFIRM #2 — remote-config path] RESOLVED: config folded into first
  `/api/chat` response as `config_slice` (present in `ChatResponse`). Single
  network surface: `POST /api/chat`. No separate remote-config GET.
- Prose vs schema divergences (schema wins, per "wireTypes.ts subordinate to the
  contract" + frozen/never-edit): underscore type discriminators; split
  `bubble`/`user_bubble`; `generating` is a first-class block; chips carry
  `{label, action:{kind,payload}}` (typed ChipAction set) rather than a bare
  `actionToken`. Recorded for the final report as [CONFIRM]-resolved, not
  escalations.

## Tasks
| # | Task | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| T1 | Scaffold Vite+React+TS under widget/ | done (npm install ok; typecheck+smoke green) |
| T2 | Generate wire types from frozen schema | done (gen:types → wireTypes.generated.ts; Block union; coverage test green) |
| T3 | Design tokens + theming | done (FinX tokens light+dark; useTheme; no-web-font grep test green) |
| T4 | Bootstrap from URL params | done (6 params → SessionContext; entry_surface from page; accessToken never persisted/logged — tests green) |
| T5 | Mock server + fixtures | done (typed fixtures per block from prototype copy; MSW+Vite share handleChat; 14 ajv validations vs frozen schema; config_slice turn-0-only) |
| T6 | chatClient + conversation state | done (single network surface POST /api/chat; append-only log; single-flight one-POST-per-action; E-TIMEOUT synth on transport fail; >5s slow; accessToken echoed not logged) |
| T7 | Render-block component set | done (11 components + RenderBlock switch; shared prototype CSS; each renders from fixture; unknown type = no-op; chip dispatch verbatim) |
| T8 | Interaction contracts | done (stepper reopen clears downstream [widget+server]; calendar hard-disable min/max/disabled_ranges/maxRangeDays; note-list 10/page + dividers + conditional badge; data-card arbitrary groups) |
| T9 | Shell + entry surfaces | done (WidgetFrame collapse/unread/position-persist; AppSheet full-screen slide-up + swipe-down; Header/Composer/ComplianceFooter; SupportEntry fixed + ReportsEntry rotating placeholder). Added PointerEvent polyfill to test setup for drag/swipe. |
| T10 | WebMCP registration | done (send_message/tap_chip/get_conversation_state via document.modelContext; webmcp-types@0.1.2 devDep TYPE-ONLY reference [no runtime import/polyfill]; feature-detected no-op; routes to same dispatch) |
| T11 | App assembly + mock entrypoint | done (App wires bootstrap→theme→seed→shell-by-platform→WebMCP; build ok 58 modules; 4 integration tests incl. full stepper→file walk) |
| T12 | Agent-driven E2E | done (drove built widget on dev:mock via real Chromium; 6/6 steps PASS, console clean; caught + fixed a browser-only bug jsdom missed) |

Current task: all tasks done — next is fresh 3-verifier panel (round 1)

## Agent-driven E2E evidence (doneCondition item 7)
- Harness: `/browse` daemon Chromium won't launch here (kernel blocks
  unprivileged user namespaces → "No usable sandbox"; the daemon exposes no
  --no-sandbox). Project Playwright MCP would hit the same wall. Drove the
  built widget with a direct Playwright script (playwright-core, launch
  args ['--no-sandbox'], reusing the ms-playwright chrome-headless-shell) —
  same engine, agent-driven.
- Repro: `npm --prefix widget run dev:mock` (serves http://localhost:5178),
  then drive `http://localhost:5178/?userId=X008593&page=support&platform=web`.
  Driver script (throwaway, in session scratchpad): loads entry, sends free
  text "Get my P&L", taps Equity → This FY → PDF, asserts the file card.
- Result: 6/6 steps PASS, console clean. Screenshot captured.
  1 entry surface (greeting X008593 + chips + "Ask anything about FinX…" +
    compliance footer) PASS
  2 free-text → user_bubble "Get my P&L" + stepper segment PASS
  3 tap Equity → segment done, period active (This FY) PASS
  4 tap This FY → format active (PDF + Excel) PASS
  5 tap PDF → file_card PnL_Equity_FY2025-26.pdf + "196 KB · PDF · password: PAN"
    + Download + "Trouble opening it?" PASS
  6 no uncaught console errors PASS
- BUG CAUGHT (browser-only, jsdom masked it): Conversation stored
  setTimeout/clearTimeout as instance fields and called them as methods
  (this !== window) → Chromium "Illegal invocation" crashed block rendering
  (wg-body empty). Fixed by invoking the globals through plain-function
  wrappers. jsdom tolerated the method receiver, so unit tests were green;
  only the real-browser E2E exposed it. Fix committed.
